  <p>I worked on this project to demonstrate fully autonomous behaviour of a quadrotor using a vision sensor for position estimation. You can check out it's demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbOuMlFG0Y">here</a>. It was fun working on this project!.</p>

Available <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCIP.2015.7100731">here</a>.

  <p>Also worked on another cool project where the quadcopter could identify and follow it. Sorry I don't have a video of this project, but if you believe me - it worked!. Wrote a paper on this which was accepted at an IEEE conference, but didn't have the resources to make it there.</p>
