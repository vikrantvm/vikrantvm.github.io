  <h1>My research and projects</h1>
	<p>Vikrant More, Sarthak Kaingade, Pradeep Gaidhani, Nitin Gupta, "Visual odometry using optic flow for unmanned aerial vehicles",<i> IEEE Proceedings of 2015 International Conference on Cognitive Computing and Information Processing</i>. Available <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCIP.2015.7100731">here</a>. I worked on this project to demonstrate fully autonomous behaviour of a quadrotor using a vision sensor for position estimation. You can check out it's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbOuMlFG0Y">demo</a>.</p>

  <p>Also worked on another cool project where the quadcopter could identify a colored object and follow it. Sorry I don't have a video of this project, but if you believe me - it worked! Wrote a small paper on this which was accepted at an IEEE conference, but I didn't have the resources to make it there.</p>

	<p>Tools I love: ROS, Gazebo, OpenCV.</p>
