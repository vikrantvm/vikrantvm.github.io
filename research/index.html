	<p>"Multipoint cable cam system and method".<i></i> US Patent (granted) US11169522B2. https://patents.google.com/patent/US11169522B2/
	<p>"Visual odometry using optic flow for unmanned aerial vehicles",<i> IEEE Proceedings of 2015 International Conference on Cognitive Computing and Information Processing</i>. I worked on this project to demonstrate fully autonomous behaviour of a quadrotor using a vision sensor for position estimation. Paper: http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCIP.2015.7100731". Video demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KbOuMlFG0Y</p>
    <p>Also worked on another cool project where the quadcopter could identify a colored object and follow it. Wrote a small paper on this which was accepted at an IEEE conference, but I didn't have the resources to make it there.</p>
